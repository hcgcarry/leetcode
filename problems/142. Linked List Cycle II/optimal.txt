To understand this solution, you just need to ask yourself these question.
Assume the distance from head to the start of the loop is x1
the distance from the start of the loop to the point fast and slow meet is x2
the distance from the point fast and slow meet to the start of the loop is x3


x1 + x2 + x3 + x2 = x1+x2+x1+x2 (because fast move two time of distance of slow move)
Thus x1 = x3
